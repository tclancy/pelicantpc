# True Love: A Play in One Act

OUTDOORS - NIGHT - FENWAY PARK

<em>A nice April night, game is in the middle innings, Kevin Youkilis coming up to bat.</em>

<strong>Michelle</strong>: After this at bat, I'm going to the bathroom, no matter what Youk does.
<strong>Me</strong>: What if he cries out your name?
<strong>Michelle</strong> (<em>pensively</em>): I'm still going to the bathroom
