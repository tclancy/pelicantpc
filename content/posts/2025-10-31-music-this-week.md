# Music This Week

Trying something new, here are a couple of things I've been playing on repeat.

## Brian Dunne, _Clams Casino_

Safely inside my Dad Rock, Springsteen-inspired category, I think I found this via Xgau's Substack. The whole album is amazing and the previous one is great too.

## Tunde Adebimpe, Thee Black Boltz

Absolutely amazing album from _TV on the Radio_ singer. Has me revisiting them and his back catalog. Ignore the opening 36 second track unless you're young enough not to be totally over those things since rap casettes in the '80s.
