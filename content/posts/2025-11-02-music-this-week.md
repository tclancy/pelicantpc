# Music This Week

Didn't expect to be back so soon, but I got busy doing something<sup>*</sup> this weekend and what I was listening to
finished and Spotify's Recommended let me know The Beths have a new album out and it's just as good as the last one (for the record, it was good).

\* I was unsuccessfully debugging a goddamn expensive Andersen door that's been the bane of my existence since install. They have some really cool self-help app the customer support will walk you through. It uses fancy vision algos and stuff. And doesn't do shit for me.
