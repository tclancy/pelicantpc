# Expression Engine if Clauses

This is the kind of thing that's not worth a blog post except some day it might save one person hours of frustration. Expression Engine apparently doesn't like it when if statements either span multiple lines or when the trailing curly brace is pushed to a new line. I can't quite run down which it is, but it's not all that important: if your if clause isn't behaving as expected, make sure it's all on one line without any extraneous whitespace.
