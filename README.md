# TPC Portfolio and Blog Relaunch

## TODO

- Some static assets don't show up due to absolute pathing
  - Wordpress links?
  - find and replace on to /legacy may be a trick (http://localhost:8000/dear-josie-weasel-words.html)
- Remove escaped quotes, e.g., http://localhost:8000/rich-get-richer-play-one-act.html
- Look at history of other project to see edits to posts for static assets (after everything is set)
- Fix theme paging links or change theme (workflow setting update!)
- Add home and other [static pages](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#pages) as needed
- Figure out URL this will live at when done

### Bonus Points

- oEmbed support in importers
- Add [syntax highlighting](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#syntax-highlighting)
- Search?
