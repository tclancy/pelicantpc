## TODO

- Fix theme paging links or change theme (workflow setting update!)
- Add home and other [static pages](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#pages) as needed
  - Add imagery

### Bonus Points

- oEmbed support in importers: https://micawber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Search? There's a js plugin, do I really care?
- Add a tag to any post starting with "Twitter Updates" or just put a "hide" status on them
