# TPC Portfolio and Blog Relaunch

## TODO

- No links for portfolio pages right now?
- Static assets don't show up due to absolute pathing
- Look at history of other project to see edits to posts for static assets (after everything is set)
- Add [static pages](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#pages) as needed
- Set repo to GitHub pages and install action
- Figure out URL this will live at when done

### Bonus Points

- Sort [syntax highlighting](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#syntax-highlighting)
- Search?

## Links

- [Pelican docs](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/)
