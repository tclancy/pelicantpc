# TPC Portfolio and Blog Relaunch

### Bonus Points

- oEmbed support in importers: https://micawber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
  - Not sure if I need it; if so, here's an example content/posts/2013-06-12-parochialism.md
    - problem is there are lots of embedded youtube and similar in things, so it would need some testing
  - Swap ://twitter.com to ://x.com?
  - Add requirement to hook
- Add a tag to any post starting with "Twitter Updates" or just put a "hide" status on them
- Music blogging for favorites -- create a landing page

## Portfolio

- Do it in sync with A-Team portfolio rebuild
- Automatically add media from Django if possible, remove things like `thumb:1`

## Improve Blog Posts
